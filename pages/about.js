      <p>
        I'm a web developer from Edmonton Alberta Canada. Originally an
        Electronics Technologist with a C and Assembly Language programming
        background, I discovered the power of JavaScript and haven't looked
        back. I'm constantly amazed at the power of modern web technologies and
        what can be done with it.
